# decide to make this file executable

# the python interpreter will start executing
# code wherever it sees it in the file, so your
# solution could simply be the body of the file
# however, the following line, if included, will
# be executed if the current file (fizzbuzz.py)
# is the file on which the python3 interpreter
# was called.

# you see this quite a bit in idiomatic python, so
# we include it here to induce good habits

    # - if the number is divisible by 3, print 'fizz'
    # - if the number is divisible by 5, print 'buzz'
    # - if the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, print 'fizzbuzz'
    # - otherwise, print the number
